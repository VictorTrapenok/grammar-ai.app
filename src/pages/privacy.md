### 1. Information We Collect

The App does not require you to create an account. Depending on how you use the App, the following types of data may be collected:

**Text Data**: The text you input for grammar correction and translation is processed by our AI service. This data is not stored permanently and is used only to provide the correction/translation service.

**Device Information**: Such as device model, operating system version, app version, and crash reports.

**Usage Data**: Anonymous analytics about app interactions (for example, how often you use grammar check vs translation features) for performance improvements.

The App does not collect or store personal information.

### 2. How We Use Information

We use the collected data only to:

- Process your text for grammar correction and translation
- Improve app stability and performance
- Understand general usage patterns to enhance the App
- Detect and fix technical issues

We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. Your text data is processed securely and is not retained after processing.

### 3. Third-Party Services

The App may use third-party tools (for example, Google Play Services, Firebase Analytics, or crash reporting tools). These services may collect and process data as described in their own privacy policies.

### 4. Data Retention

We keep collected information only as long as necessary to provide and improve the App. Non-personal usage data may be stored for analytical purposes.
